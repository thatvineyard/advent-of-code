## About ##

>"Your tenacity for making things that make other things so that people can make things is alarming." -a beta tester

>Hi! I'm Eric Wastl. I made Advent of Code. I hope you like it! I also made Vanilla JS, PHP Sadness, and lots of other things. You can find me on Twitter and GitHub.

>Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

> If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to [Share] it with others, or directly via PayPal or bitcoin.
